# Compiler-Design--low-level-language
## Two major functionalities are:
Assembly-like instruction: It reads a specific ADD operation and processes it at the binary level, directly manipulating register values, which is similar to the way real hardware works. 
Register manipulation: This compiler interacts with a register file, retrieves values, performs binary arithmetic, and updates the register file. This emulates a key function of a CPU.
